DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION

In the previous project i implemented a wordpress based solution, Project 7 was a continuation of that.
Moving further i added some more value to our solutions that a DevOps team could utilize. I was introduced to a set of DevOps tools that will help 
the team in the  day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects. The Tooling solution consist of Jenkins,
kubernetes, Rancher, Grafana just mention a few. I was required to spin 3 webservers and 1 nfs server in redhat and 1 database server in ubuntu.

The task was to implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

I repeated the basic early steps for project 6 which was centered on disk partitioning and creating mount points for the logical volumes.

I installed and configured the NFS server to start running.

I Configured access to NFS for clients within the same subnet using the command: sudo vi /etc/exports, after that i exported apps, logs & mount.

In order for NFS server to be accessible from your client, you must also open following ports: TCP 111, UDP 111, UDP 2049

The next thing i did was to install and configure mysql on the database server.

I configured nfs client on all 3 webservers using the command: "sudo yum install nfs-utils nfs4-acl-tools -y".

I mounted /mnt/apps directory in the nfs server in the /var/www in the webserver, to enable the webserver have access to the nfs server and vice versa.

I installed Apache on the webserver.

I update the websiteâ€™s configuration file to connect to the database: var/www/html/functions.php

i substituted the correct credentials and opened the website in my browser. http://<Web-Server-Public-IP-Address-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php
