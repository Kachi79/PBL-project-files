In this project i was be tasked to prepare a storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL most times, it is a backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
I configured storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS and the focus of this exercise was to give me a practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux. I was also installed WordPress and connected it to a remote MySQL database server. This was intented to solidify my skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

The first thing i did was to spin my instances and created volumes with i attached to "webserver".

Using the lsblk command i inspected the block devices attached to the webserver.

Furthermore, i used the gdisk utility command to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks.

I sued the sudo pvs command to verify that the physical volumes were successfully created.

I also verified that the volume groups were created successfully using the sudo vgs command.

 I updated the /etc/fstab file with my own UUID.

 After that i tested the configuration with the command "sudo mount -a" and reloaded daemon with the command "sudo systemctl daemon-reload".
 
 I updated and installed wordpress on my webserver, i restarted apache and configured selinux policies by changing the ownership of the file using this 
 command:   "sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/wordpress"
 
 I installed and configured mysql on my database sever, i further configured the database server to work with wordpress.
 
I opened MySQL port 3306 on my dbserver and allowed access to the dbserver only from my WebServerâ€™s IP address, so in the Inbound Rule configuration i specified source as /32 and i enabled tcp port 80.

I then tested my configurations on the webpage using the public ip address:
