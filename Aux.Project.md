In this project, I need to onboard 20 new Linux users onto a server. Create a shell script that reads a csv file that contains the first name of the users to be onboarded.
I am required to also manually create a group called developers. 
I will also create 4 files and populate them, the files id_rsa to be populated with the private ip address.
Id_rsa.pub to be populated with the public ip address
names.csv to be populated with names of the people the will have access to the server
onbaord.sh to be populated with the shell script and a user persmission set for it
After all of these are done i will be required to send the shell script to the server, and test is with with the names from the names.csv file.
